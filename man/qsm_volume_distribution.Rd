\title{Volume distribution from QSM}
\usage{
qsm_volume_distribution(qsm, terminus_diam_cm = 4, segment_size = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{qsm}{a QSM loaded using `[load_qsm()]`.}

\item{terminus_diam_cm}{numeric - trunk diameter at which it is treated as a branch.}

\item{segment_size}{numeric length of trunk segments in which to summarize volume.}
}
\description{
This function estimates tree volume and its vertical distribution
from a QSM. The function separates the QSM into (1) trunk sections
(2) terminus (top of trunk < 4 cm dbh), and (3) primary branches.
The function divides trunk into segments defined by `segment_size`, calculates QSM volume,
For tree portions identified as branches the function only returns
the diameter. Both of these can be used in mass-volume equations
as needed.

\examples{
qsm_file = system.file("extdata", "tree_0723_qsm.mat", package='tReeTraits')
qsm = load_qsm(qsm_file)
volume = qsm_volume(qsm)
print(volume)
