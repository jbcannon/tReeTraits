\title{Get center of mass from QSM (X, Y, Z)}
\usage{
get_center_of_mass(qsm)
}
\arguments{
\item{qsm}{qsm object loaded from `[load_qsm]`.}
}
\description{
This function calculates the center of mass/volume from a QSM
by estimating the centroid of cylinder locations, each weighted
by their volume. For meaningful results, you may need to filter
out trunk sections only (e.g., `branching_order == 0`).
For center of mass, assumes constant density
within segments.
