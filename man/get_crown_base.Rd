\title{Estimate Crown base height of `LAS` representing segmented tree.}
\usage{
get_crown_base(
  las,
  threshold = 0.5,
  sustain = 2,
  segment_height = 0.25,
  quantile = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{`LAS` object from `lidR` package representing
individually segmented tree}

\item{threshold}{numeric - threshold width at which crown becomes apparent.
Recommend a width ~2X greater than anticipated DBH.}

\item{sustain}{numeric - number of segments in a row that treshold must be
exceeded before identifying start of crown. This is to exclude small segments
of crown isolated from larger continuous crown.}

\item{segment_height}{numeric - height of each segment in which to calculate area}

\item{quantile}{numeric - quantile at which width is measured
Values in the interval approaching 0 (e.g., 0.001) are recommended to
trim random noise}
}
\description{
This function estimates the crown base height by analyzing the vertical
profile of the tree using [get_area_profile()] which breaks the profile
into segments of height `segment_height`. The function estimates
segments exceed a threshold specified by `threshold` which must be exceeded
`sustain` times.
