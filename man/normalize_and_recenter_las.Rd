\title{Normalize and Recnter `LAS` object representing segmented tree.}
\usage{
normalize_and_recenter_las(las, quantile = c(0.001))
}
\arguments{
\item{las}{`LAS` object from `lidR` package representing
individually segmented tree}

\item{quantile}{Z quantile at which grown level is specified since
ground points may not be identifiable with common algorithms if
ground points are removed during segmentation}

\item{bole_height}{height of bole (in `LAS` units). If NULL, then
entire object is recentered. If specified, only points with
`Z < bole_height` are considered when finding the centroid.}
}
\description{
Function to normalize and recenter LAS object. Function calculates
ground level based on the parameter specified by `quantile`,
subtracts it from all `Z`. Similarly, the file is recentered based
on the mean XY coordinates. For trees, the optional parameter
`bole_height` can be used in which case the centroid is based only
on points with `Z < bole_height`. This allows recentering to be
based only on the tree bole, rather than including the crown.
